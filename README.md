#### Captricity API Client library written in Java

Currently, the Captricity API Client library provides methods to accomplish the following:
* Create a Batch,
* Add a Batch File to the Batch,
* Show a list of ready Batches in the account and
* Show a list of Documents (master templates) in the account

I have also provided a TestCaptricityClient.java program that calls each method to demonstrate how the code works in a consistent environment.

### Instructions for use

This code was built against **Java 1.8.0\_40** and uses **ant 1.9.4** for the build tool.

From the base of the directory, type

```
ant jar
```

A jar file named **captricity-1.0.jar** will be generated in the base directory.

Copy/move the captricity-1.0.jar file into your classpath.

and then in your java program, like is done in the example code-- TestCaptricityClient.java,

```
import com.captricity.api.CaptricityClient;
```

In order to use this code, you will also need a Captricity API Token.

To instantiate a Captricity API client object, use something like this:

```
CaptricityClient capClient = new CaptricityClient('6cf43...88b75');
```

where the parameter is your Captricity API token.

You can then use this client object to make method calls against the Captricity API, such as shown in the example below:

```
JSONObject newBatch = capClient.createBatch("name of new batch", true, false);
```

### Summary of available methods

```
public JSONArray showBatches() throws Exception {...}
```

* Returns a JSONArray of the Batches that exist in your account.
* Parameters:
  - *None*

```
public JSONObject createBatch(String name, Boolean sorting_enabled, Boolean is_sorting_only) throws Exception {...}
```

* Creates a Batch in accordance with the given name and properties.
* Returns a JSONObject representing the Batch that was created by the method call.
* Parameters:
  - *String* name - Provide a name for the Batch you are creating
  - *Boolean* sorting\_enabled \- Set to true to enable sorting for this Batch
  - *Boolean* is\_sorting\_only \- Set to true if you only want to sort this Batch (as opposed to submit for data extraction)

```
public JSONObject addFileToBatch(int batchID, String fileName) throws Exception {...}
```

* Adds the file found at the given pathname to the Batch with the specified Batch ID.
* Returns a JSONObject representing the Batch File that was just added to the specified Batch by the method call.
* Parameters:
  - *int* batchID \- Batch ID of the Batch to which you want to add file (this can be obtained from the resulting JSONObject after you create a Batch)
  - *String* fileName \- Full pathname of the file on your local file system

```
public JSONArray showDocuments() throws Exception {...}
```

* Returns a JSONArray of the Documents (master templates) that exist in your account.
