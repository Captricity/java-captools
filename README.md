Captricity API client written in Java

Very basic functionality at this point.  Currently, this script demonstrates how to create a batch, add a batch file to that batch and list existing unprocessed batches and templates.

This code was built against Java 1.8.0_40.

In order to use this code, you will also need a Captricity API Token.
