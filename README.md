#### Captricity API client library written in Java

Currently, the Captricity API client library provides methods to accomplish the following:
* create a Batch
* read (get) a Batch
* delete a Batch
* add Batch Files to the Batch
* submit the Batch for processing
* show a list of Batches in the account
* show a list of Documents (master templates) in the account

I have also provided a number of example programs that demonstrate how the API client library works in a controlled environment.  You can find these programs in the examples folder.

### Instructions for use

This code was built against **Java 1.8.0\_40** and uses **ant 1.9.4** for the build tool.

From the base of the directory, type

```
ant jar
```

A jar file named **captricity-1.0.jar** will be generated in the base directory.

Copy/move the captricity-1.0.jar file into your classpath.

and then in your java program, like is done in the example code-- TestCaptricityClient.java,

```java
import com.captricity.api.CaptricityClient;
```

In order to use this code, you will also need a Captricity API Token.

To instantiate a Captricity API client object, use something like this:

```java
CaptricityClient capClient = new CaptricityClient('6cf43...88b75');
```

where the parameter is your Captricity API token.

You can then use this client object to make method calls against the Captricity API, as is shown in the example below:

```java
JSONObject newBatch = capClient.createBatch("name of new batch", true, false);
```

### Summary of available methods

```java
public JSONArray showBatches() throws Exception {...}
```
* Returns a `JSONArray` of the Batches that exist in your account.
* Parameters:
  - *None*

```java
public JSONObject createBatch(String name, Boolean sorting_enabled, Boolean is_sorting_only) throws Exception {...}
```
* Creates a Batch in accordance with the given name and properties.
* Returns a `JSONObject` representing the Batch that was created by the method call.
* Parameters:
  - `String name` - Provide a name for the Batch you are creating
  - `Boolean sorting_enabled` \- Set to true to enable sorting for this Batch
  - `Boolean is_sorting_only` \- Set to true if you only want to sort this Batch (as opposed to submit for data extraction)

```java
public JSONObject readBatch(int batchID) throws Exception {...}
```
* Gets the Batch specified by the batchID parameter.
* Returns a `JSONObject` representing the Batch.
* Parameters:
  - `int batchID` \- Batch ID of the Batch you want to get

```java
public JSONObject deleteBatch(int batchID) throws Exception {...}
```
* Deletes the Batch specified by the batchID parameter.
* Returns a `JSONObject` representing the status of the delete request.
* Parameters:
  - `int batchID` \- Batch ID of the Batch you want to delete

```java
public JSONObject addFileToBatch(int batchID, String fileName) throws Exception {...}
```
* Adds the file found at the given pathname to the Batch with the specified Batch ID.
* Returns a `JSONObject` representing the Batch File that was just added to the specified Batch by the method call.
* Parameters:
  - `int batchID` \- Batch ID of the Batch to which you want to add file (obtained from the resulting `JSONObject` after you create a Batch)
  - `String fileName` \- Full pathname of the file on your local file system

```java
public JSONObject submitBatch(int batchID) throws Exception {...}
```
* Submits the Batch specified by the batchID parameter for processing.
* Returns a `JSONObject` representing the Batch that was submitted for processing.
* Parameters:
  - `int batchID` \- Batch ID of the Batch you want to submit for processing

```java
public JSONArray showDocuments() throws Exception {...}
```
* Returns a `JSONArray` of the Documents (master templates) that exist in your account.
* Parameters:
  - *None*
