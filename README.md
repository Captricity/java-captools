####Captricity API Client Library written in Java

Very basic functionality at this point.  Currently, the TestCaptricityClient.java program demonstrates how to create a batch, add a batch file to that batch and list existing unprocessed batches and templates using the CaptricityClient class.

### Instructions for use

This code was built against Java 1.8.0_40 and uses ant 1.9.4 for the build tool.

From the base of the directory, type

    ant jar

A jar file named captricity-1.0.jar will be generated in the base directory.

Copy/move the captricity-1.0.jar file into your classpath.

and then in your java program, like is done in the example code-- TestCaptricityClient.java,

    import com.captricity.api.CaptricityClient;

In order to use this code, you will also need a Captricity API Token.

To instantiate a Captricity API client object, use something like this:

    CaptricityClient capClient = new CaptricityClient('6cf43...88b75');

where the parameter is your Captricity API token.

You can then use this client object to make method calls against the Captricity API, such as shown in the example below:

    JSONObject newBatch = capClient.createBatch("name of new batch", true, false);
		
### Summary of available methods

```
public JSONArray showBatches() throws Exception {...}
```

* Returns a JSONArray of Batches that exist in your account.
* Parameters
  - *None*

```
    public JSONObject createBatch(String name, Boolean sorting_enabled, Boolean is_sorting_only) throws Exception {...}
```

* Returns a JSONObject representing the Batch that was created by the method call.
* Parameters
  - *String* name - Provide a name for the Batch you are creating
  - *Boolean* sorting\_enabled \- Set to true to enable sorting for this Batch
  - *Boolean* is\_sorting\_only \- Set to true if you only want to sort this Batch (as opposed to submit for data extraction)

<br/>
```
public JSONObject addFileToBatch(int batchID, String fileName) throws Exception {...}
```
	
* Returns a JSONObject representing the Batch File that was just added to the specified Batch by the method call.
* Parameters
  - *int* batchID \- Batch ID of the Batch to which you want to add file (this can be obtained from the resulting JSONObject after you create a Batch)
  - *String* fileName \- Full pathname of the file on your local file system
